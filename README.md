# HighFive

Cozmo uses hand gesture recognition to recognize when you hold up two fingers to "high-five" him. He holds up his lift and waits for you to tap. He gets happy when you do and annoyed if you don't.

# Dependencies

The modules required in addition to the `Cozmo` module are:

* numpy
* Common
* OpenCV

Common is a package included in the Git repo: https://github.com/Wizards-of-Coz/Common

I have used OpenCV3 with the project. You will need to install OpenCV following the instructions on their website.

The other modules can be installed via pip if not already present:
`pip3 install numpy`
